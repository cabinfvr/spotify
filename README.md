## ðŸš€ deploying with vercel tutorial

you can get all your spotify credentials from ðŸ‘‰ [spotify.dev](https://spotify.dev)
to generate a refresh token, go here ðŸ‘‰ [spotify-refresh-token-generator.netlify.app](https://spotify-refresh-token-generator.netlify.app/)

after you deploy, head to your **vercel dashboard**
ðŸ‘‰ go to your project â†’ **settings** â†’ **environment variables**
add these:

```
SPOTIFY_USERNAME = your spotify username

SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI = https://spotify-refresh-token-generator.netlify.app/
# (can technically be anything valid, itâ€™s not used in prod but required for token gen)

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = your client id from spotify.dev

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = your client secret from spotify.dev

SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN = your refresh token from spotify-refresh-token-generator.netlify.app
```

once thatâ€™s done, redeploy + boom ðŸŽ§ðŸŒˆðŸŽ¶
